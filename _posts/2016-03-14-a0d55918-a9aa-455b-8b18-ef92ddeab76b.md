Next to listing a property on the local MLS and the internet, making the property look attractive to buyers is the most important thing an agent must do. With 80% of home buyers shopping for a home online (according to the NAR), the way your listings look is an important factor, if not the most important, in generating buyer interest. It's no secret. Better-presented homes generate more traffic and more buyer interest; therefore, selling faster. More than ever, your listings must stand out from the crowd.
